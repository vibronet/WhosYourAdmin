# WhosYourAdmin
This is a quick and dirty snippet you can use to identify administrators in your tenant, in case you need to contact them.
There might be better ways of doing it; if I'll find out about them, I'll update the readme here.
Please don't use the app in production. The app lacks error management, only covers the easiest cases and is generally something written at the end of a Saturday night. That's just for giving you an idea of how this can work.
There are a number of gotchas, please refer to the comments in program.cs for some headsups.
